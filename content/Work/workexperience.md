**Erie Insurance:**

At Erie Insurance this past summer, I worked as a Data Intern in the Treasury Department.
The people that I worked with were helpful and welcoming. Through this opportunity, I learned how to work in a professional environment: utilizing programs such as Qlik and SAS to complete a bad debt project, collaborating with other interns on projects, and presenting my work in front of leadership. I would love to be able to continue working in a more marketing focused position to be able to gain a wider variety of experience.

*Bad Debt Dashboard*

Working with finance data, my main project was to create a Bad Debt Qlik Dashboard. This Dashboard created a one-stop-shop view of ERIE's bad debt data, and through that, it helped contribute to better visualization and less manual labor.

Some of the main points from this project are:
- Paralleled quarterly report for Controller from Excel
- Saved about 2 hours of manual labor per quarterly
- Found and fixed issues within the source data when transferring
- Created visuals to better explain bad debt & overage data
- Compared bad debt data to direct written premium (DWP) data at state & product level to find connections
- Found connections between unemployment rates and bad debt data

*Innovation Project:*

- Collaborated with other interns to identify and develop improvements to be made during the new employee onboarding process
- Conducted interviews with new hires
- Presented work & solutions

*Data Intern Group Project:*

- Collaborated with other data interns to create and integrate a data request form to be used throughout various departments in the company
