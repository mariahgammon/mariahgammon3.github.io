Here are some school projects that I have worked on.

**Project 1: Photoshop**

This project was done in my Electronic Art class. I utilized photoshop to create a visualization of ways to communicate with animals.

**Project 2: Emoji**

This project was also done in Electronic Art. I created a new emoji that I think could be useful.
