Updates from Assignment 3:
Article 1: “How Nonprofits Can Use Storytelling and Engagement Metrics to Improve How They Share their Philanthropy Narrative” - Mary McInerney
- This article describes how nonprofit organizations use storytelling as an effective strategy to promote their philanthropy and increase engagement with donors/customers. It emphasizes how important it is for data and storytelling to be combined and work together in a company's strategies, as they are often seen separately. Data driven decision making is highly important and can work for businesses, specifically nonprofits, to gauge how successful their strategies are at engagement with customers/donors. This article emphasizes how nonprofits use authentic storytelling as a method to engage customers and then measure that engagement through data. It shows how to analyze the metrics of storytelling such as through Google Analytics to make business decisions.
- This article aims to answer questions about what methods of marketing strategies work effectively, specifically for nonprofits. It highlights the storytelling aspect combined with data analysis as a very effective measure to take and commits research to back up its theories.
- For one, this article acknowledges that oftentimes the combination of storytelling & data to work together in marketing strategies is overlooked, and part of the goal of this article is to expain and give reason as to why they should be seen together more often and how beneficial this method would be.
- This article uses a few different methods to perform/back up their research. The primary data used is a review of academic studies and literature as well as interviews of experts to see insight into how this method helps nonprofits share their narrative and increase engagement. The secondary data was collected from organizational analytics on readership and engagement metrics as part of a University of San Francisco case study, plus responses made by donors and alumni about how philanthropy stories impact them.
- The results show that audiences become more engaged through a steady stream of high quality, authentic stories. It also supports the university's goals to promote their philanthropies and a "more just, humane, and sustainable world." By collecting data and analyzing it, this study was able to use their findings to show that the research question is answered in that audiences tend to become engaged through storytelling. The article makes a point to mention that not all stories are the same but the literature and data show that nonprofits should use storytelling that focuses on impact because it develops engagement with their audiences.
- This article validates its results by explaining how the data and literature support their ideas. They use a real case study done at University of San Francisco that used storytelling to reach their audiences, then showed the data/Google Analytics results for engagement, and then interviewed donors to see why those stories were impactful. They show resultst that the pageviews for philanthropy stories has consistenly increased.
Article 2: "Data-Driven Decision Making in Nonprofit Organizations" - Amanda Kline
- This article/study aims to describe how nonprofits use data to impact their decision making; specifically through strategic fundraising, mission drift avoidance, and limitations and obstacle organizations encounter involving the collection and analysis of data during the decision making process.
- This article discusses how nonprofits have been "under scrutiny" from funders, clients, etc. and aims to show how data gathering and analysis can be used by nonprofits to help make business decisions.
- "1. How do nonprofit organizations use data to inform fundraising strategies?
How do nonprofit organizations use data to prevent mission drift?
What challenges prevent nonprofit organizations from using data to inform decisions?"
- The study wants to show how nonprofits can utlize data in their business decisions and strategic initiatives while avoiding "mission drift." The article also aims to identify and discuss common obstacles to data usage and ways to rebuff them.
- This article/study found that when funding sources are focused on the same or similar missions as the organization, it is easy and beneficial for both parties to collect and analyze data and promote their mission as opposed to when organizations accept funding streams without analyzing the data and mission behind it.
- "Findings suggest that mission drift is best avoided by using outcomes based data to drive organizational decision making (Carman & Fredericks, 2008).When meaningful evaluative data is consistently collected, analyzed, and used to guide strategic planning, mission drift is unlikely to occur, and mission advancement is probable (Carman & Fredericks, 2008)."
- This article delivers/validates results for strategic fundraising and mission drift avoidance, giving examples for both and how these methods can be utilized towards nonprofit organziations' data driven marketing decisions.
- Article 1 & Article 2: : I think it could be cool to look into ways that nonprofits use marketing strategies, specifically by combining storytelling and data analysis to make business decisions. I've been doing research into how nonprofit organizations use marketing strategies and how they use data to effectively measure how these strategies work to reach their intended audiences and spread their philanthropy.
