I am a junior at Allegheny College studying Integrative Informatics with a minor in Writing.

Integrative Informatics basically teaches you to be able to communicate data effectively with a focus in a specific field, which in my case is Marketing. I take core courses in computer science, communication, and media classes, as well as a variety of Marketing classes. I am able to use this combination of knowledge to analyze data and make effective and progressive decisions.

Math and writing have always been my favorite subjects, and I am hoping to be able to incorporate both into my future endeavors. I am also looking forward to being able to gain a variety of experiences.

I enjoyed and appreciated my experience working at Erie Insurance this past summer. The people that I worked with were helpful and welcoming. Through this opportunity, I learned how to work in a professional environment: utilizing programs such as Qlik and SAS to complete a bad debt project, collaborating with other interns on projects, and presenting my work in front of leadership. I would love to be able to continue working in a more marketing focused position to be able to gain a wider variety of experience.


At Allegheny College, I have developed skills that are important to thrive in a marketing focused position. Attending a liberal arts school and majoring in an interdivisional study like Integrative Informatics has provided me with a wide variety of knowledge and expanded my written and oral communication skills.

Being involved in organizations, on top of my coursework, has helped to strengthen my work ethic and time management skills, as well as the leadership and volunteer experience these organizations give me independently. As a sister of Delta Delta Delta, I am part of a team that must meet and work together to make decisions and plan for new projects.
