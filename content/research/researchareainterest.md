I am an Informatics major with a focus in marketing, so I want to be able to center my work around something to do with data driven marketing. 
 I also have realized that I prefer establishing theory/analyzing data to coding. Maybe I could do something with
 holding/visualizing data (perhaps through a dashboard) and then analyzing it to help businesses make marketing decisions.
 I would also like to find an industry to focus on, and like I said, I have experience with insurance but might have an interest in nonprofits or using data that
 encourages conservation/sustainability by businesses or individuals and then coming up with a marketing plan to get people to act on it.
