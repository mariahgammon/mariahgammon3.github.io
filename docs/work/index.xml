      <description>Erie Insurance:
At Erie Insurance this past summer, I worked as a Data Intern in the Treasury Department. The people that I worked with were helpful and welcoming. Through this opportunity, I learned how to work in a professional environment: utilizing programs such as Qlik and SAS to complete a bad debt project, collaborating with other interns on projects, and presenting my work in front of leadership. I would love to be able to continue working in a more marketing focused position to be able to gain a wider variety of experience.</description>
