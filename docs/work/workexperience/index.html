<p><strong>Erie Insurance:</strong></p>
<p>At Erie Insurance this past summer, I worked as a Data Intern in the Treasury Department.
The people that I worked with were helpful and welcoming. Through this opportunity, I learned how to work in a professional environment: utilizing programs such as Qlik and SAS to complete a bad debt project, collaborating with other interns on projects, and presenting my work in front of leadership. I would love to be able to continue working in a more marketing focused position to be able to gain a wider variety of experience.</p>
<p><em>Bad Debt Dashboard</em></p>
<p>Working with finance data, my main project was to create a Bad Debt Qlik Dashboard. This Dashboard created a one-stop-shop view of ERIE&rsquo;s bad debt data, and through that, it helped contribute to better visualization and less manual labor.</p>
<p>Some of the main points from this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paralleled quarterly report for Controller from Excel</li>
<li>Saved about 2 hours of manual labor per quarterly</li>
<li>Found and fixed issues within the source data when transferring</li>
<li>Created visuals to better explain bad debt &amp; overage data</li>
<li>Compared bad debt data to direct written premium (DWP) data at state &amp; product level to find connections</li>
<li>Found connections between unemployment rates and bad debt data</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Innovation Project:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborated with other interns to identify and develop improvements to be made during the new employee onboarding process</li>
<li>Conducted interviews with new hires</li>
<li>Presented work &amp; solutions</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Data Intern Group Project:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborated with other data interns to create and integrate a data request form to be used throughout various departments in the company</li>
</ul>
