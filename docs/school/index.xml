      <description>Here are some school projects that I have worked on.
Project 1: Photoshop
This project was done in my Electronic Art class. I utilized photoshop to create a visualization of ways to communicate with animals.
Project 2: Emoji
This project was also done in Electronic Art. I created a new emoji that I think could be useful.</description>
